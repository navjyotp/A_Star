# A-Star Algorithm

<ul>
<li> Enter integer values for all the user inputs
<li> The code will stop if points entered are in obstacle space
<li> The images will be generated in different windows 
<li> Python libraries used: numpy, cv2, math, heapq, matplotlib
<li> If the points entered are close to the obstacle space, the algorithm may take time
<li> Clearance entered should be reasonable  
</ul>
